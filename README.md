# Smorphi_BlockCode_Template
Smorphi Full module Example (Block-Code Style)

I created this code where the program behaves at least somewhat the same as the one on the WefaaaRobotics Imaginary Smorphi Simulation.

### How To Use??
Scroll down until you find the `originalBlockDiagramBehavior` function and add whatever you want inside it.
inside this function the command will run only once from top to bottom just like the Imaginary Simulation on the Website (Though this is just the very basic and simple for of it)
